# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Introduction
Customer churn, the rate at which customers discontinue services or stop doing business with a company, is a critical metric for businesses. Predicting customer churn helps companies take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and enhance customer satisfaction. This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
In this project, we use historical customer data to identify patterns that can help predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. We perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build machine learning models to predict churn. The best-performing model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Data Source
The data for this project was obtained from [Telecom Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about customers, such as their gender, tenure, monthly charges, internet service, online security, contract type, etc.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning and preprocessing

## Data Preprocessing
We preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting categorical columns with binary values to numeric representation, and performing one-hot encoding for other categorical columns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA techniques are applied to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and understand the distribution of variables. We analyze variables like tenure, monthly charges, contract type, etc., to understand their impact on customer churn.

## Model Building and Evaluation
We build and evaluate five different machine learning models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes
3. Decision Tree
4. K-Nearest Neighbors
5. Support Vector Machine

Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated for each model, and confusion matrices are visualized.

## Findings and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we provide key findings regarding customer churn and offer recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
